# Application that allows authenticated users to upload files of any size (hardware resources permitting)

## BE
- Implement an API endpoint that allows users to upload files of any size (hardware resources permitting).
- Efficiently handle large file uploads, make sure to prevent memory issues.
- Implement a way to authenticate users before allowing them to upload files.
  (For simplicity, you can hard-code a set of valid usernames and passwords.)
- Dockerize the application.
- Write test cases covering critical backend functionalities. Focus on testing file upload endpoint.

## FE
TODO


## Notes
- Used a single docker image for both api and test containers
